Introduction
-----------------------------
This project was built in order to display annotated 3d models, specifically, models of Ancient Egyptian coffins for the project 
Book of the Dead in 3D. It takes a model which has had hitboxes added to areas of interest. These hitboxes are mapped to annotations in xml files.
The built process translates the xml files into static pages.

Requirements
----------------------------
For osx, Homebrew is recommended, as is virtualenv.
-Python3
-Latest JDK; Works with Oracle JDK 12.0.2
-XMLStarlet  (brew install xmlstarlet)
-Saxon (brew install saxon)
-Python classical languages toolkit (in the requirements.txt) (pip install -r requirements.txt)

Use
------------------------------
-Build script requires an assets folder. You can put this anywhere, but there ought to be a symlink to it a level up from whatever 
directory the build script is in.
-Your assets directory should look like this:
    -assets
        -coffin name/
            -coffinname.gltf
            -texts/
                -coffinname.gly
                -text1.svg
                -text2.svg
                etc.
- To generate HTML pages from the xml files in src, you need to run build.py. chmod +x on build.py and ./build.py 
to run in the current directory. Basically, the hitbox names in the model (gltf file) need to map to a text.svg in your xml file for the page.xml correpsonding
with the object. The xml maps both of these with a translation. The template of what the xml is supposed to be is
defined in the tools/schema/page.xslt and site.xslt.
-The resulting html files and svgs will be placed in the dist directory, from which they can be served.
