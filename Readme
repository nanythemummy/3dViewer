Introduction
-----------------------------
This project was built in order to display annotated 3d models, specifically, models of Ancient Egyptian coffins for the project 
Book of the Dead in 3D. It takes a model which has had hitboxes added to areas of interest. These hitboxes are mapped to annotations in xml files.
The built process translates the xml files into static pages.

For osx, Homebrew is recommended, as is virtualenv.
-Python3
-Latest JDK; Works with Oracle JDK 12.0.2
-XMLStarlet  (brew install xmlstarlet)
-Saxon (brew install saxon)
-Python classical languages toolkit (in the requirements.txt) (pip install -r requirements.txt)

Use
------------------------------
-Build script requires an assets folder. You can put this anywhere, but there ought to be a symlink to it a level up from whatever 
directory the build script is in.
-Your assets directory should look like this:
    -assets
        -coffin name/
            -coffinname.gltf
            -texts/
                -coffinname.gly
                -text1.svg
                -text2.svg
                etc.
